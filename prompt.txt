instructions:
Create an HTML5/JavaScript application. 
Use only Claude Artifacts compatible libraries. 
There will be two layouts, based upon which platform 
the page is loaded on. The game is for two players to 
play air-hockey. Each player has direct control of a 
sliding paddle as the puck bounces around according 
to the laws of physics. On a phone, the 
interface will be touch driven. 
And the court will be in portrait mode so that 
players will be at opposite sides of the board. 
Controls will be a sliding finger where force is 
determined by forward motion of the finger and paddle 
location is influenced by moving the finger left and right 
on the input strip. Each player will have a separate touch 
sensitive input strip. On a computer, the keyboard will 
control the input. There will be two direction keys for 
each player, a left and a right, and one 'power' button 
which charges the force of a hit. 
the longer you hold the button, the higher the force 
goes up to a maximum where it slowly starts 
to fall off if the player doesn't release. 
Player one will use the z and x direction keys and 
the space bar to charge. Player 2 will use the left and 
right arrows with the up arrow to charge.

   the red player should have a touch panel on the same side as the red paddle. The two input paddles should be
    behind their respective goal lines.

--- third draft of the file elided -----

follow up prompt: excellent! now make the ball start moving when the first player clicks on their side of the board. 
have it go in a random direction seeded by the clock.
